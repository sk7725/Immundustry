name: T Helper Cell Signal
description: "The T helper cells (Th cells), also known as CD4+ cells, are a type of T cell that play an important role in the immune system, particularly in the adaptive immune system. They help the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell cytokines. These cells help suppress or regulate immune responses. They are essential in B cell antibody class switching, in the activation and growth of cytotoxic T cells, and in maximizing bactericidal activity of phagocytes such as macrophages. \n\n[royal]This item symbolizes the T Helper Cell Pathway, which is essential for T cell immune response triggering. In reality, almost every pathogen has multiple, different Antigens.[]"
