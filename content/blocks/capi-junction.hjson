They are the smallest blood vessels in the body: they convey blood between the arterioles and venules. These microvessels are the site of exchange of many substances with the interstitial fluid surrounding them. \n\n[royal]This exists for illustration or mechanical purposes; it doesn't exist in your body, or not in this form.[]"
